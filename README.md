### Creative Tilt
1.) One thing our group is very proud about is how well we modularized everything using OOP.
    We tried to make everything as separate as possible to make it easy to make changes and
    make the development process as smooth as possible. Another technique we used was loading
    in spritesheets that have similar names using a for loop, rather than loading them one by
    one.

2.) From an aesthetic perspective, we committed to uniting our mechanics and art within the 
    context of a classroom notebook. Because our game revolves around forming - or "writing" - 
    words from a series of random letters, we intentionally lent animations a wobbly "scribbled" 
    look, and used real paper and pencils to record sounds befitting our hand-drawn style.
